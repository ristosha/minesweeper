# minesweeper

My first project on SvelteKit is a minimalistic Minesweeper with theming support.

Built on [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/),
[pure-rand](https://github.com/dubzzz/pure-rand) (random
seed), [phosphor-svelte](https://github.com/haruaki07/phosphor-svelte)
(icons).

To start the project use:
`npm run dev`.

For production -
`npm run build` and then
`npm run preview`
